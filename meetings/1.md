Use for Pizza:
z.umn.edu/sign

Ideas for functionality:

* 4 microcontrollers that need to communicate
* green line departure times
    * transit api?
* UMN bus times
    * more of a pain with getting the data
* ACM UMN upcoming events
    * event RSS feed?
* the current weather
* UMN kernel ban status 
    * always set to true
* (Garfield) Joke/Strip of the day
* Game of Life
* Server closet temperature
* ACM feedback messages

Teams:
* Display
    * Will be working on the unified display layer -- there should be a "virtual display" that components can use 
      that will then be split between each of the 4 actual displays.
* Transit
    * Will be working on the green line/UMN bus info component 
* Weather
    * Will be working on the weather component 
* RSS reader
    * Will be working on a component display an RSS feed (especially of upcoming ACM UMN events :))
* Game Of Life
    * Will be working on a component that runs a conway's game of life simulation
