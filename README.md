# ACM Project 1

This is the repository for the ACM Project -- a programming project worked on the ACM UMN student chapter as a club.

We will be creating the software powering an e-ink display that will be hung in the ACM room made of 4 [inkplate 10](https://www.crowdsupply.com/soldered/inkplate-10) displays.
Notes from our in person meetings can be found [here](/meetings)
Our tech stack will be C based, using the ink plates built in support for the android library.
